          <h4>What I learned</h4>
          <p>
            I learned that it was actually pretty challenging to listen to a 1.5 hour lecture on pretty technical code that I knew nothing about. In the future I will try and have more of an understanding of the material by spending at least half an hour reviewing
            topics before going. Also, will also try and go to ones that looks like they will foster more networking rather than just info on a technical topic.
          </p>
          <h4>Questions I have</h4>
          <p>
            Still pretty much don't understand what was discussed yesterday. So guess a big question is what the whole GatsbyJS and Reason stuff was. Have a high level understanding of what React is but not the difference/interaction with GatsbyJS.

          <h4>Who I met</h4>

            Josh Hudgins - Google Product Manager Cassandra Cummings - Director of Content, Product School
          </p>
          <h4>What I learned</h4>
          <p>
            I learned that one of the most important traits that a good product manager can have is understanding the problem. The speaker made a point that stuck with me which is that it is better to have the right problem rather than the right solution. He gave
            several examples of where data can mislead people if they don't use their intuition/heurisitc to understand it appropriately. He also made clear that the product manager's role is to maintain the vision and ensure that all of the potential
            blockers to executing that vision are removed.
          </p>
          <h4>Questions I have</h4>
          <p>
            One question I have is wondering if the fact that I am also working on my own company will be a red flag for companies if I am interviewing for a full time job as well.

          <h4>Who I met</h4>
          <p>
            Chris Oltyan, CEO of Rebric Jim Lamancusa, CEO of Cusa Tea
          </p>
          <h4>What I learned</h4>
          <p>
            I learned about two start ups. One of them was called Rebric. It is a company that is supposedly using machine learning to source candidates to companies. I learned from Chris's pitch that one should be clearly state what their product is. The first question
            that somemone had after he finished his pitch was what his product was. I also learned that one should not slam the audience that is voting for you. He made an unintended zing saying that Galvanize graduates typically have poor resumes. The
            other pitch was Jim Lamancusa. He crushed it. I learned about his tea making process. He developed a instant tea process formula that sounds like they are first to market. We learned about his growth strategy as well. While I am not interested
            in being a marketing manager we learned that he was hiring his second employee.
          </p>
          <h4>Questions I have</h4>
          <p>
            I still have several questions on what Rebric actually does. Also, I have questions on how to pitch at the next event. I will most likely contact the lady that was running it.
