          <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
          <p>
            Earlier today I learned how to use git and github. I set the stage by making sure that I am in a place where I don't get distracted. As you can see in the picture below. I set the stage by going to a coffee</p>

          <p> I am learning git and github in order to understand that a fundamental tool for development.</p>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            I played with the content by going ahead testing out different ways to do a push. For example, I had previously done git push master origin because that is what I had previously done but tried it just do
          </p>
          <h4>What's Next</h4>
          <p>
            Being able to use git and github is setting the foundation to be able to collaborate with other developers. In the future I will learn the nuances of adding to open sourced projects

        <button class="accordion">15 Feb 18 - DOM DOM DOM DOM....DOM.....!!!!</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
          <p>
            I set the stage by turning off all of my notifications.
            I also set of goal of working through and reading three of the links with DOM.</p>
            <p><a href= "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mt9COH3AiFxrWcMfMKGXa3s3BR42eelH/view?usp=sharing">Setting the stage</a></p>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            The concept of DOM is coming into focus. Took notes and read through the three links that I wanted to.
            Struggled with the concepts by going back and referring to the previous resources as I read through newer ones.
            Setting the stage helped me in the play phase because it kept me focused on completing the three links and not
            having a "quick" distraction and checking slack or the facebooks.

          </p>
          <h4>What's Next</h4>
          <p>
            Next steps with DOM include reading through the rest of the resources provided and then starting the drills

        <button class="accordion">21 Feb 18 - Wunderful!!!!</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
          <p>
            I set the stage by getting a cup of coffee and water prepared so I wouldn't have to get up mid session. I also set the stage by getting to Galvanize early and leaving the rest of my bag in the class room and coming to the atrium where I won't get distracted
            by other classmates getting here early as well. You can see evidence in the link below. I am learning to use wunderlist because I currently use a bunch of digital post its on my laptop and believe this is inefficient.

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            I have successfully set up wunderlist on my laptop and my phone. Setting the stage by coming to a place where I won't be disturbed and having my coffee and water ready allowed me to get set up in one sitting. I "played" with wunderlist by figuring out
            how to manage the lists. I watched somebody's youtube video on their best practices and examples of how they use it.
          </p>
          <h4>What's Next</h4>
          <p>
            I plan to use this technology in the future by putting all of the things I need to do for personal, work, and class in there.
